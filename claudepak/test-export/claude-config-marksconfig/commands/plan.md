Help me create a step-by-step plan for $ARGUMENTS and get my approval before proceeding.

**Collaborative Planning Process:**
1. Ask clarifying questions to understand the goal
2. Present a high-level plan with clear steps
3. Wait for approval before moving to implementation
4. Break down complex tasks into manageable pieces
5. Verify understanding at each major milestone

Please start by asking what specific aspects of "$ARGUMENTS" I want to focus on, then present a structured plan that we can review together.
