Let's research $ARGUMENTS together - I'll guide what to investigate.

**Guided Research Process:**
1. Present a research plan for approval
2. Search and gather information step by step  
3. Ask if findings warrant deeper investigation
4. Collaboratively organize notes and documentation
5. Suggest follow-up research directions

Please start by outlining what aspects of "$ARGUMENTS" we should investigate, then wait for my guidance on which areas to explore first.
